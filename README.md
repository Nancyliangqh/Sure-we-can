Topic: Python Applied in Quantitative Trading
Group Members: Wenda Guo, Xia Chu, Qinxin Wu, Qihan Liang

Backgrounds:
With the development of Quantitative Trading, python has already transferred lots of  mathematical models into practical applications with more profits. It plays an important role in financial industry since it helps us to make decisions more efficiently and accurately in this rapidly changing world. However, capital market can always be influenced by many factors. Especially, the stock fluctuates in a way that is hard to detect. In order to catch the opportunity and maximize the profit, we need to apply different strategies to find better a prediction for the stock market.

Our goal:
We are planning to implement several classical mathematics models into practice through python and evaluate their performance using financial data.
We will choose some quantitative trading strategies, some of which are the latest ones and some of which are popular in the fields now. The operational mechanism of those strategies is exactly the function we would like to realize in our coding----when, what, and how much to trade given a certain circumstance in the market. To do so, we will scrape data from web to test the strategiesâ€™ efficiency and their precision of forecasting and yields.
