## 4501 Project: Python Applied in Stock Investing Strategies

**Group name:** Sure-we-can

**Group Members:** Wenda Guo, Qihan Liang, Qinxin Wu, Xia Chu

**Backgrounds:**
With the development of Quantitative Trading, python has already transferred lots of  mathematical models into practical applications with more profits. It plays an important role in financial industry since it helps us to make decisions more efficiently and accurately in this rapidly changing world. However, capital market can always be influenced by many factors. Especially, the stock fluctuates in a way that is hard to detect. In order to catch the opportunity and maximize the profit, we need to apply different strategies to find better a prediction for the stock market.

**Our goal:**
We implemented three quantitative trading strategies using python and evaluated their performance by comparing their rate of returns for a period of 2 years. The first strategy is the theoretical analysis of classic theory -- Markowitz Model and the later two strategies are the ones popular to use in the field now. The dataset used for our project includeds daily close price and volume of the day for the most active 263 stocks from Yahho Finance for the past two-year time period from 2016-11-21 to 2018-11-20.

**Strategy 1: Markowitz Model Investing(theoratical analysis)**

Choosing stock portfolio based on Markowitz mean-variance model, which is based on the expected returns (mean) and the standard deviation (variance) of different portfolios in a time period. Generating a large number of random portfolios from the existed stock pool, picking up the portofolio with high sharpe ratio(return per risk). Also, we use a package to find the optimal portofolio with highest rate of return and the proportion of the choosing stocks in the pool.
1. Use log function to generate the return of each stock	
2.	Generate 1000 random portfolio to make simulations
3.	Use Markowitz model to calculate the mean rate of return and volatility of each portfolio
4. Find the point with highest rate of return and least volatility
5.  Draw graphs to clarify the results and make it as the basis for later comparison

**Strategy 2: High-yield Investing**

The most common strategy for investment is always choosing the stock with the highest yield, and make quick changes to the allocation based on the changes in the combination of stocks. The High-yield Investing model chooses stock portfolio based on N stocks with the highest yield, and make changes to allocation based on the changes in the list of stocks that belongs to the top N number of highest yields. In a simple High-yield Investing model, we assume that the asset used to buy each stock is equally distributed.

*Procedures*
1. Set N number of stocks to put in portfolio and the total initial asset wanted to use. In our specific model, we chose N = 30.
2. Calculate yield by changes in market capitalization and choose top 30 stocks with the highest yield to make our stock combination.
3. Buy all 30 stocks on the first day and make changes on every trading day by comparing the combinations from 2 days:
  * Sell the stock if it was in the last trading day's combination but not in today's. 
  * Buy the stock if it is in today's stock combination not the last trading day's (number of shares to buy is decided by the total asset available and the price of the stock that day).
4. Repeat step3 for every day included in our dataset to perform stock reallocation on every trading day and calculate the change in rate of return for time period from 2016-11-21 to 2018-11-20.

**Strategy 3: Small-Cap Investing**

The most popular short_term strategy is choosing stocks with the smallest market capitalization as they have more chances to increase in values. Choosing stock portfolio based on N stocks with the smallest market capitalization, and make changes to allocation based on the changes in the list of stocks that belongs to the top N number of smallest market capitalization. In a simple Small-Cap Investing model, we assume that the asset used to buy each stock is equally distributed. In our specific model, we chose N = 30 as the number of stocks will be considered for allocation every time we want to perform a change (the next stock exchange day).

*Procedures*
1. Set the number of stocks to put in portfolio, N = 30 and the total initial asset wanted to use.
2. Find the first 30 number of stocks with the smallest market capitalization of the day to form our initial combination. 
3. Compare with top 30 smallest the next day to determine what stocks and how many shares to sell or buy:
  * Sell the stock if the market capitalization of the current holding stock is not small enough anymore (not in the new combination of 30 stocks)
  * Evenly distribute available asset to buy new stocks (from the current combination of 30 stocks with the smallest market capitalization).
4. Repeat step3 for every trading day included in our dataset to perform stock reallocation on every stock exchange day and calculate the change in rate of return for time period from 2016-11-21 to 2018-11-20.
